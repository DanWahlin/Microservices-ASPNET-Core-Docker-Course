# Node.js with MongoDB and Docker Demo

Application demo designed to show how Node.js and MongoDB can be run in Docker containers.
The app uses Mongoose to create a simple database that stores Docker commands and examples.

##To run the app with Docker Containers:

###Starting the Application with Docker Compose

1. Install Docker for Windows or Docker for Mac (If you're on Windows 7 install Docker Toolbox: http://docker.com/toolbox).

2. Open a command prompt at the root of the application's folder.

3. Run `docker-compose build`

4. Run `docker-compose up`

5. Run `docker exec -it [containerID] sh` to sh into the running container.

6. Run `node dbSeeder.js` to seed the database with sample data.

7. Navigate to http://localhost:3000 (http://192.168.99.100:3000 if using Docker Toolbox) in your browser to view the site. This assumes that's the IP assigned to VirtualBox - change if needed.

##To run the app with Node.js and MongoDB (without Docker):

1. Install and start MongoDB (https://docs.mongodb.org/manual/installation).

2. Install Node.js (http://nodejs.org).

3. Open `config/config.development.json` and adjust the host name to your MongoDB server name (`localhost` normally works if you're running locally).

4. Run `npm install`.

5. Run `node dbSeeder.js` to get the sample data loaded into MongoDB. Exit the command prompt.

6. Run `node server.js` to start the server.

7. Navigate to http://localhost:3000 in your browser.
